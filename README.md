## Markdown to HTML Converter
This is a command-line tool that converts a Markdown file to an HTML file. The tool takes two arguments:

* The name of the Markdown file to be converted.
* The name of the output HTML file.

### Installation
To use this tool, you must have Python 3 installed. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Usage
To convert a Markdown file to an HTML file, run the following command:

#### python3 markdown2html.py <input-file> <output-file>

  Replace <input-file> with the name of the Markdown file you want to convert, and <output-file> with the name of the HTML file you want to create.

For example:

Copy code
python3 markdown2html.py README.md README.html
This will convert README.md to HTML and write the output to README.html.

### Notes
If the Markdown file does not exist, the tool will print an error message and exit.
The tool follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
This tool can be used to convert any Markdown file to HTML, regardless of its content or structure. However, the resulting HTML file may require additional formatting or editing to ensure it meets your specific needs.
